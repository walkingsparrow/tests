\format{
  Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. 

  Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description
  
----------------------------- 

Id / integer / -- / index of each observation

Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant) 

Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement 

Diameter	/ continuous / mm / perpendicular to length 

Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell 

Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone 

Shucked weight / continuous	 / grams / weight of meat 

Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding) 

Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried 

Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
}

\note{Lazy data loading is enabled in this package. So the user does not
need to explicitly run \code{data(abalone)} to load the data. It will be
loaded whenever it is used.}

\details{
  Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of
  abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining
  it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring
  and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to
  obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as
  weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be
  required to solve the problem.  

From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by
200).
