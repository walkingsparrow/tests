Comments on GPDevGuideDraft_11Sept.pdf

• Need Shengwen to put up a guide for installing GPDB + ORCA

• p.57, is the example really using composite types?
   ◦ seems ok. SQL version of composite type

• Move PivotalR into MADlib chapter

• MADlib’s SVM example is bad, maybe ARIMA or logistic regression

• Maybe improve MADlib chapter name to include “Machine learning” or “analytics” etc
